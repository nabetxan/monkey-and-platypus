![Gameboard](../monkey-and-platypus/src/img/Platypus_vs_Monkey.png)

## How to Play

1.  The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.

2.  Player has 6 Platypuses or 6 Monkeys. There are 2 small
    pieces, 2 medium pieces, and 2 large pieces for each player.

3.  Player place one of their pieces to the gameboard cell in
    turn.

4.  Just like the Tic Tac Toe, the game ends when one player
    lines up three cells in a row with their character, either
    horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

5.  The big difference from Tic Tac Toe is that the player can
    either put their piece from their hand OR move the piece which
    is already on the gameboard.

6.  Even if there is already another piece on the cell,
    regardless of whether it belongs to you or your opponent, if the
    piece is smaller, you can place your piece over it.

7.  Player cannot move the piece if it's underneath of another
    bigger piece.
